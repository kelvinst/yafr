# YAFR

Yet Another File Remover.

YAFR (pronounce like wafer) is a command line tool for improve the file removing. It is in very alpha version, so I didn't really know what it will do someday (and when it does, be sure that will be here). Keep in track of the [issues list](https://github.com/kelvinst/yafr/issues) to keep up with the planned and the new features.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'yafr'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yafr
